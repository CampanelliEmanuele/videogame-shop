## Project Description

The goal of the project was to develop an e-commerce platform for video games, applying the theoretical skills acquired during the 3-month course.

The basic requirements included implementing CRUD operations for essential entities and consequently creating a suitable user-administrator interface.

We then enhanced the project by implementing a (trivial) security module and integrating graphs.
